    Abstract interface for EpisodicMemory key-value storage.

    This interface defines the contract for storing and retrieving EpisodicMemory documents
    in a key-value store. The key is the MongoDB ObjectId (as string), and the value
    is the JSON-serialized EpisodicMemory document.

    Implementations should handle errors gracefully and return None/False on failures
    rather than raising exceptions, to ensure KV-Storage issues don't break the main
    MongoDB-based workflow.
