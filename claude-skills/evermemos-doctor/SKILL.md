## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: After Fresh Install

```
User: I just installed EverMemOS, is it working?

Claude: Let me run a health check to verify everything is set up correctly.

[Executes: /evermemos-doctor]

Great news! All checks passed 🎉

The installation looks good. You're ready to:
1. Start the service: /evermemos-start
2. Try the memory features: /evermemos store "Test" user
```

---

### Scenario 2: Troubleshooting Startup Issues

```
User: EverMemOS won't start, I keep getting errors

Claude: I'll diagnose the problem for you.

[Executes: /evermemos-doctor]

============================================================
Found 2 issues:

1. Port 1995 (in use by another service)
   Fix: Change port in .env or stop conflicting service

2. Python dependencies
   Fix: Install with: uv sync
============================================================

I can see two problems:
1. Port 1995 is already in use by another program
2. Some Python packages are missing

Let me help you fix these:

First, let's install the dependencies:
[Executes: uv sync]

For the port conflict, would you like to:
a) Stop the other service using port 1995
b) Configure EverMemOS to use a different port
```

---

### Scenario 3: Performance Issues

```
User: EverMemOS is running but seems very slow

Claude: Let me check the system health and resource usage.

[Executes: /evermemos-doctor]

============================================================
⚠️  Warnings:
- Low memory: 0.4 GB free
- Found 15 errors in recent logs
============================================================

I found two issues affecting performance:

1. **Low Memory**: Only 400MB free
   - EverMemOS needs at least 500MB
   - Try closing other applications

2. **Errors in Logs**: 15 recent errors detected
   - Let me check the logs: /evermemos-start logs

[Checks logs and identifies specific issue]

The logs show MongoDB connection timeouts. Let me check
if MongoDB is running properly...
```

---

### Scenario 4: Unknown Issues

```
User: Something's not right but I don't know what

Claude: No problem! I'll run a comprehensive diagnostic.

[Executes: /evermemos-doctor]

============================================================
All checks passed! ✅
============================================================

Actually, everything looks healthy:
- ✅ Service is running
- ✅ API is accessible
- ✅ No errors in logs
- ✅ Good resource availability

Could you describe what behavior you're seeing? This will
help me investigate further.

## What Gets Checked

| Category | Checks |
|----------|--------|
| **System** | Python version, OS, architecture |
| **Project** | Directory structure, source code |
| **Config** | Environment files, settings |
| **Storage** | Data directory, permissions, disk space |
| **Dependencies** | Python packages, required libs |
| **Service** | Running status, PID, API access |
| **Network** | Port availability, connectivity |
| **Resources** | Disk space, memory, CPU |
| **Logs** | Recent errors, warnings |

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Python version too old
```
❌ Python version (need 3.8+, found 3.7)

```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install python3.11

# macOS
brew install python@3.11
```

---

### Issue: uv not found

Fix: Install with: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Solution:** Claude can run the install command automatically.

---

### Issue: Configuration missing
```

Fix: Run: /evermemos-setup to create configuration
```

**Solution:**
```bash
/evermemos-setup lite
```

---

### Issue: Port already in use
```
❌ Port 1995 (in use by another service)
Fix: Change port in .env or stop conflicting service
```

**Solution 1: Find and stop conflicting service**
```bash
lsof -i :1995
kill <PID>
```

**Solution 2: Change port**
Edit `.env` and set:
```
SERVER_PORT=1996
```

---

### Issue: Data directory not writable
```
❌ Data directory (writable)
Fix: Check permissions: chmod 755 data/
```

**Solution:**
```bash
chmod 755 data/
```

---

### Issue: Dependencies missing
```

Fix: Install with: uv sync
```

**Solution:**
```bash
cd /path/to/EverMemOS
uv sync
```

---

### Issue: Service not running
```
❌ Service running
Fix: Start with: /evermemos-start
```

**Solution:**
```bash
/evermemos-start

## Integration with Other Skills

### After Setup
```
User: /evermemos-setup lite

Claude: Setup complete! Let me verify everything is working.

[Executes: /evermemos-doctor]

✅ All checks passed! Installation successful.
```

### Before Starting
```
User: /evermemos-start

Claude: Let me first check if everything is ready.

[Executes: /evermemos-doctor]

❌ Found issue: Dependencies missing

Installing dependencies first...
[Fixes issue]

Now starting the service...
```

### Periodic Health Checks
```
Claude: I notice you've been using EverMemOS for a while.
Would you like me to run a health check?

[User agrees]

[Executes: /evermemos-doctor]

Everything looks good! ✅
```

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

1. **After installation** - Verify setup
2. **Before starting** - Check prerequisites
3. **Troubleshooting** - Diagnose issues
4. **Periodic checks** - Ensure health
5. **Performance issues** - Check resources
6. **Unknown errors** - Find root cause

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | All checks passed |
| 1 | Some checks failed |

## Advanced Usage

### Run from command line
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/evermemos-doctor/scripts/doctor.py
```

### Custom project directory
```bash
python3 scripts/doctor.py --project-dir /path/to/evermemos

    echo "Health check passed"
else
    echo "Issues found"
fi
```

## Success Criteria

Doctor is satisfied when:

✅ All basic checks pass
✅ Dependencies installed
✅ Configuration valid
✅ Service can start
✅ No critical errors in logs
✅ Adequate resources available

## Limitations

- Cannot fix all issues automatically (yet)
- Some checks require service to be running
- Network issues may affect some checks
- Platform-specific checks may vary

## Future Enhancements

- Automatic fixing of common issues
- More detailed performance analysis
- Network connectivity tests
- Database connection validation
- Integration with monitoring tools
