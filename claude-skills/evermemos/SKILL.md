description: Search memories using EverMemOS. PROACTIVELY search before answering ANY project-related questions. Use when user asks about past conversations, previous decisions.ALWAYS check history before implementing features, debugging issues, or suggesting solutions. Maintain project continuity across sessions.
argument-hint: "search <query> [method] [top_k]"

# EverMemOS Memory Integration

## Commands

The script to invoke is always:
```
~/.claude/skills/evermemos/scripts/evermemos_client.py
```

### search

Search memories by query.

```
/evermemos search <query> [method] [top_k]
```

- `method`: `keyword`, `vector`, `hybrid` (default), `rrf`, `agentic`
- `top_k`: max results (default: 5)

**When to use — ALWAYS trigger when:**
- User asks "What did we discuss about X?" / "Did we fix that bug?" / "What approach did we decide on?"
- Any question containing: "last time", "before", "previously", "earlier", "remember"
- Before implementing features (check past approaches)
- Before debugging (check similar past issues and solutions)
- User mentions specific modules, files, or components → search that component first
- User asks how something works in THIS project

**Execute:**
```bash
python3 "$HOME/.claude/skills/evermemos/scripts/evermemos_client.py" search "<query>" [method] [top_k]
```

## Proactive Usage Rules

**Rule 1 — Search first, answer second (default behavior):**

```
User asks a question
    ↓
Is it about THIS project?
    YES → SEARCH FIRST (covers 90% of cases)
    NO  → Is it a general programming question?
            YES → Answer directly (but consider project context)
            NO  → SEARCH FIRST (be safe)
```

When in doubt, search. Missing context costs hours; an unnecessary search costs seconds.

**Rule 2 — Multi-angle search for complex questions:**

Don't search once and give up. Search multiple related angles:
```bash
python3 "$HOME/.claude/skills/evermemos/scripts/evermemos_client.py" search "authentication implementation"
python3 "$HOME/.claude/skills/evermemos/scripts/evermemos_client.py" search "auth bug fix"
python3 "$HOME/.claude/skills/evermemos/scripts/evermemos_client.py" search "auth security pattern"
```

**Rule 3 — Before major code changes:**
1. Search for similar past implementations
2. Search for related bugs
3. Search for design decisions on the topic

Then implement using past context.

## Configuration

```bash
export EVERMEMOS_BASE_URL="http://localhost:1995"   # API endpoint
export EVERMEMOS_USER_ID="claude_code_user"         # User identifier
# group_id is auto-derived from the current working directory:
#   Format: project_<full_path>  e.g. project_/home/op/git/EverMemOS
# Override only when needed:
# export EVERMEMOS_GROUP_ID="project_/some/specific/path"
```

## Retrieval Methods

- `keyword`: exact text match, fast
- `vector`: semantic similarity, understands meaning
- `hybrid`: keyword + vector combined (recommended default)
- `rrf`: Reciprocal Rank Fusion, advanced ranking
- `agentic`: AI-powered intelligent retrieval

---

## Troubleshooting

**Connection error:** Check that EverMemOS is running (`curl http://localhost:1995`) and `EVERMEMOS_BASE_URL` is correct.

**No results:** Try different keywords, switch to `hybrid` or `vector` method, or increase `top_k`. Verify the correct `user_id` and `group_id` are in use.

**Permission error:** Ensure Python 3 is installed (`python3 --version`) and the script is executable (`chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/evermemos/scripts/evermemos_client.py`).
