"""Search Result Test Demo

Purpose:
    Verify that the memory system correctly retrieves topic-relevant memories.
    10 Q&A pairs cover 10 completely unrelated topics with sharp boundaries.
    Then 10 queries (one per topic) confirm retrieval accuracy.

Topics:
    1.  Soccer / Champions League
    2.  Stock market / Tesla
    3.  Cat care after vaccination
    4.  Cooking / Italian pasta recipe
    5.  Travel / Japan trip planning
    6.  Python programming / async patterns
    7.  Fitness / strength training
    8.  Classical music / Beethoven concert
    9.  Ancient Roman history
    10. Space / James Webb Telescope discoveries

Expected result:
    Each query should return only memories related to its own topic,
    with no cross-topic contamination.

Prerequisites:
    Start the API server first (in another terminal):
    uv run python src/run.py

Run:
    uv run python src/bootstrap.py demo/search_result_test_demo.py
